# sidekick.nvim
An outline window that's always by your side (except for when it's not).

### Roadmap

- [ ] Use treesitter to generate outline for "standard" queries (`queries/$LANG/locals.scm`)  
- [ ] Sort by order or kind.  
- [ ] Use treesitter to generate outline for custom queries (`queries/$LANG/sidekick.scm`)  
- [ ] Generate outline based on LSP.  
- [ ] Pop-up documentation for symbol when using LSP.  


### Maybe features  

- [ ] Generate outline based on tags file.  
- [ ] When using treesitter for outline *and* LSP is available, pop-up documentation for symbol.
